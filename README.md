BROAD-C : BROAD Dynamic Experimental Design with C++
====================================================
C/C++ code for Bayesian Rapid Optimal Adaptive Design.

Computes experimental designs to test theories (and parameters). Designs are changed rapidly and adaptively based on responses to experiments. Designs are scored based on the Equivalence-Class Edge-Cutting (EC2) criterion. Currently set up to compare Risky Choice theories.
